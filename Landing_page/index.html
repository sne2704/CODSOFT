    Hello! My name is <strong>Sneha GK</strong>, and I am a college student currently pursuing 
    my degree <br> in Computer Science. I have a strong interest in web development and enjoy 
    learning how websites and applications<br>are built. I am skilled in the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I love experimenting with 
    different designs and projects <br>to improve my knowledge. I enjoy working on hands-on 
    projects like calculators, landing pages, and personal portfolios.

    As a student, my goal is to keep learning new technologies, build exciting projects, 
    and prepare myself for opportunities in the software and web development field.
